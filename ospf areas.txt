1. 🔸 Backbone Area (Area 0)
The core of an OSPF network.

All other areas must connect to Area 0 (either directly or via virtual links).

All inter-area traffic must pass through it.

🧠 Think of it as the central highway for routing.

2. 🔸 Standard (Normal) Area
Can contain internal routers and may learn routes from other areas via ABRs.

Supports all LSA types (1–5, 7).

Can be connected directly to the backbone.

3. 🔸 Stub Area
Blocks external routes (Type 5 LSAs) from entering the area.

Instead, gets a default route (0.0.0.0) from the ABR.

Reduces routing table size and processing.

🔐 Good for small remote areas.

4. 🔸 Totally Stubby Area (Cisco proprietary)
Blocks both:

Inter-area routes (Type 3 LSAs)

External routes (Type 5 LSAs)

Gets only a default route from the ABR.

🔒 Even more restrictive than stub — for minimal routing overhead.

5. 🔸 Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)
Allows external routes to be injected into OSPF from within the area (e.g., from a redistribution point).

Instead of Type 5 LSAs, it uses Type 7 LSAs, which are later converted to Type 5 by the ABR.

🌐 Used when external routes (like from another routing protocol) are redistributed into a stub-like area.

6. 🔸 Totally NSSA (Cisco proprietary)
Like NSSA, but also blocks Type 3 LSAs (inter-area routes).

Only allows default route + Type 7 LSAs from redistributed sources.ś
